## Description
*Bip! Bip! Bip! Boop! Everyone loves PONG! So everyone loves thirty six PONGS even more! Work those learning muscles with EDUTAINMENT PONG! Get serious with SERIOUS PONG! Shoot a laser gun in LASER PONG! Play PONG in PONG PONG! And many more!*

Originally released on 11 April 2012) PONGS was written in ActionScript 3 using FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library.

This version has been ported to the also excellent [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) library for JavaScript.

You may not be surprised to hear that *PONGS* is based on Atari's PONG. Sound effects were made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/). The font in PONGS is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/). The references in PONGS are mostly pretty obvious, but if you haven't heard of [Shit Snake](http://www.draknek.org/games/shitsnake/) by [Draknek](http://www.draknek.org/) or [B.U.T.T.O.N.](http://gutefabrik.com/button.html) by [Die Gute Fabrik](http://gutefabrik.com/), then now you have!
